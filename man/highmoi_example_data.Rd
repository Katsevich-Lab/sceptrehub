\description{
The example high-MOI CRISPRi data are taken from the paper "A genome-wide framework for mapping gene regulation via cellular genetic screens" by Gasperini et al., 2019. The authors used a CRISPRi-based assay to target 5,000+ putative enhancers in a population of K562 cells. The authors additionally targeted 200+ gene transcription start sites (TSSs) and designed a library of 100 non-targeting gRNAs to serve as negative controls. The genes, gRNAs, and cells are downsampled for inclusion in the example data.

\details{
The example data are stored in a list containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{response_matrix}: the gene-by-cell expression matrix
\item \code{grna_matrix}: the gRNA-by-cell expression matrix
\item \code{extra_covariates}: a data frame containing a single column, \code{batch}, specifying the batch in which each cell was sequenced (\code{batch_1} or \code{batch_2})
\item \code{gene_names}: the human-readable name of each gene
}
